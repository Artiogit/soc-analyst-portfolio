Social Engineering & Human Attack Vectors – SOC Analysis

### Scenario ###
An organization experienced multiple security incidents caused by the weakest point:
human behavior, including phishing, poor password practices, and lack
of security awareness.


### Objective ###
Identify how human factors can be exploited as attack vectors and
define detection, prevention, and response strategies from a SOC
perspective.

### Attack Vectors Identified ###
An employee downloaded software from an untrusted freeware hosting site.
Although the software appeared legitimate (7-Zip), it contained a
malicious executable compressed within a ZIP archive in an attempt
to evade antivirus detection.

The antivirus successfully detected the malicious file, blocked its
execution, and placed it under quarantine for further investigation.

### Tools used ###
- Procmon
- PEstudio

### Recommendations ###
- Enforce application control policies to prevent users from installing
  unauthorized software from untrusted sources.
- Implement application allow-listing for approved software.
- Conduct regular security awareness training focused on software
  downloads and social engineering risks.
- Enhance endpoint protection by monitoring archive-based malware
  delivery techniques.

### Conclusion ###
Human behavior remains one of the most exploited attack vectors.
SOC teams must combine technical controls with user awareness and
continuous monitoring.
